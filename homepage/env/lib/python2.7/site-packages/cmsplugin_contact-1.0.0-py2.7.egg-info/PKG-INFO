        Django CMS Contact Form Plugin
        ==============================
        
        Contact form plugin for `Django CMS <http://www.django-cms.org/>`_ with spam protection and i18n.
        
        If you want to use ReCAPTCHA you have to get a Public and Private Key from http://www.google.com/recaptcha. You can get them for free.
        
        The Akismet spam protection method requires an Akismet API Key which is obtainable from http://akismet.com/ For private persons this is free, too.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python Libs
        -----------
        
        If you decide to use the ReCAPTCHA spam protection method you need to install the python library "recaptcha-client" (package ``python-recaptcha`` in Debian).
        
        If you use Akismet for spam protection "akismet" is needed. You also need to set your domain url in django admin "sites".
        
        Both libraries can be installed by ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.
        
        It is recommended but not required to use South. Again it can be easily installed by or ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.
